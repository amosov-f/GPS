Each satellite has such description:
name        - name of satellite
dt_s        - satellite clock correction
t_oe        - epoch
WN          - week
e           - eccentricity of the orbit
A_sqrt      - sqare root from semimajor axis
Omega0      - longitude of the ascending node of the orbit plane to the time period
i0          - inclination for the time period
omega       - argument of perigee
M0          - mean anomaly at the beginning of an era
dn          - deviation of the mean motion
velOmega    - rate of change of the longitude of the ascending node
IDOT        - the rate of change of inclination
c_uc        - quadrature amplitude correction of the argument of latitude
c_us        - amplitude-phase correction of the argument of latitude
c_rc        - quadrature amplitude correction radius of the orbit
c_rs        - amplitude-phase correction radius of the orbit
c_ic        - quadrature amplitude correction of the inclination
c_is        - amplitude-phase correction of the inclination
P           - pseudo-distace to satellite
t_obs       - obscuration time
t_sun		- how many days have passed since sunday? For example, now if tuesday, this parameter is 2.
